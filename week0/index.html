      <h2 id="bio1" class="research"> Bad News for the Highly Intelligent </h2>
    
    <div class="post">   <p> There are advantages to being smart. People who do well on standardized tests of intelligence—IQ tests—tend to be more successful in the classroom and the workplace. Although the reasons are not fully understood, they also tend to live longer, healthier lives, and are less likely to experience negative life events such as bankruptcy. </p>
<p> Now there’s some bad news for people in the right tail of the IQ bell curve. In a study just published in the journal Intelligence, Pitzer College researcher Ruth Karpinski and her colleagues emailed a survey with questions about psychological and physiological disorders to members of Mensa. A “high IQ society,” Mensa requires that its members have an IQ in the top 2 percent. For most intelligence tests, this corresponds to an IQ of about 132 or higher. (The average IQ of the general population is 100.) The survey of Mensa’s highly intelligent members found that they were more likely to suffer from a range of serious disorders. </p>
 <p> The survey covered mood disorders (depression, dysthymia and bipolar), anxiety disorders (generalized, social and obsessive-compulsive), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. It also covered environmental allergies, asthma and autoimmune disorders. Respondents were asked to report whether they had ever been formally diagnosed with each disorder or suspected they suffered from it. With a return rate of nearly 75 percent, Karpinski and her colleagues compared the percentage of the 3,715 respondents who reported each disorder to the national average. </p>
<p>The biggest differences between the Mensa group and the general population were seen for mood disorders and anxiety disorders. More than a quarter (26.7 percent) of the sample reported that they had been formally diagnosed with a mood disorder, while 20 percent reported an anxiety disorder—far higher than the national averages of around 10 percent for each. The differences were smaller, but still statistically significant and practically meaningful, for most of the other disorders. The prevalence of environmental allergies was triple the national average (33 percent vs. 11 percent). </p>
<p>To explain their findings, Karpinski and her colleagues propose the hyper brain/hyper body theory. This theory holds that, for all of its advantages, being highly intelligent is associated with psychological and physiological “overexcitabilities,” or OEs. A concept introduced by the Polish psychiatrist and psychologist Kazimierz Dabrowski in the 1960s, an OE is an unusually intense reaction to an environmental threat or insult. This can include anything from a startling sound to confrontation with another person. </p>
<p> Psychological OEs include a heighted tendency to ruminate and worry, whereas physiological OEs arise from the body’s response to stress. According to the hyper brain/hyper body theory, these two types of OEs are more common in highly intelligent people and interact with each other in a “vicious cycle” to cause both psychological and physiological dysfunction. For example, a highly intelligent person may overanalyze a disapproving comment made by a boss, imagining negative outcomes that simply wouldn’t occur to someone less intelligent. That may trigger the body’s stress response, which may make the person even more anxious. </p>
<p> The results of this study must be interpreted cautiously because they are correlational. Showing that a disorder is more common in a sample of people with high IQs than in the general population doesn’t prove that high intelligence is the cause of the disorder. It’s also possible that people who join Mensa differ from other people in ways other than just IQ. For example, people preoccupied with intellectual pursuits may spend less time than the average person on physical exercise and social interaction, both of which have been shown to have broad benefits for psychological and physical health. </p>
<p>All the same, Karpinski and her colleagues’ findings set the stage for research that promises to shed new light on the link between intelligence and health. One possibility is that associations between intelligence and health outcomes reflect pleiotropy, which occurs when a gene influences seemingly unrelated traits. There is already some evidence to suggest that this is the case. In a 2015 study, Rosalind Arden and her colleagues concluded that the association between IQ and longevity is mostly explained by genetic factors.  </p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, this research may ultimately lead to insights about how to improve people’s psychological and physical well-being. If overexcitabilities turn out to be the mechanism underlying the IQ-health relationship, then interventions aimed at curbing these sometimes maladaptive responses may help people lead happier, healthier lives.</p>

<h2 id="bio2" class="research"> Number of species on Earth tagged at 8.7 million </h2>

<div class="post"><p> There are 8.7 million eukaryotic species on our planet — give or take 1.3 million. The latest biodiversity estimate, based on a new method of prediction, dramatically narrows the range of 'best guesses', which was previously between 3 million and 100 million. It means that a staggering 86% of land species and 91% of marine species remain undiscovered. </p>
      <p>Camilo Mora, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and his colleagues at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, have identified a consistent scaling pattern among the different levels of the taxonomic classification system (order, genus, species and so on) that allows the total number of species to be predicted. The research is published in PLoS Biology1 today. </p>
<p>Mora argues that knowing how many species there are on Earth is one of the most important questions in science. "Finding this number satisfies a basic scientific curiosity," he says. </p>
<p> Bob May, a zoologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who wrote a commentary on the work2, agrees. "Knowing how many plants and animals there are on the planet is absolutely fundamental," he says. He also highlights the practical significance: "Without this knowledge, we cannot even begin to answer questions such as how much diversity we can lose while still maintaining the ecosystem services that humanity depends upon." </p>
<p> But the unstinting efforts of field taxonomists are not going to provide the number any time soon. In the more than 250 years since Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus began the science of taxonomy, 1.2 million species have been identified and classified — less than 15% of Mora's new total. At this pace, May estimates that it will take another 480 years to complete the job of recording all species. </p>
      <p> <strong> The catalogue of life </strong> </p>
<p> Instead, scientists have tried to predict the total number of species from the number already known. Some of the estimates amount to little more than educated guesses. "These predictions are unverifiable and experts change their mind," says Mora. Other approaches use assumptions that he describes as "unreliable and easy to break". </p>       
<p> Mora's method is based on an analysis of the taxonomic classification for all 1.2 million species currently catalogued. Linnaeus's system forms a pyramid-like hierarchy — the lower the category, the more entities it contains. There are more species than genera, more genera than families, more families than orders and so on, right up to the top level, domain. </p>
<p> Mora and his colleagues show that a consistent numerical trend links the numbers in each category, and that this can be used to predict how many entities there should be in poorly catalogued levels, such as species, from the numbers in higher levels that are much more comprehensively described. </p> 
<p> However, the method does not work for prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) because the higher taxonomic levels are not well catalogued as is the case for eukaryotes. A conservative 'lower bound' estimate of about 10,000 prokaryotes is included in Mora's total but, in reality, they are likely to number in the millions </p> 
<p> "The unique thing about this approach is that we are able to validate it," he says. "By testing the predictions against well catalogued groups such as mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, we were able to show that we could predict the correct number of species." </p> 
<p> The analysis also reveals that some groups are much better known than others. For example, some 72% of the predicted 298,000 plant species on land have already been documented, in comparison with only 12% of predicted land animal species and 7% of predicted land fungi species. </p> 
<p> May is impressed. "I like this approach. Not only is it imaginative and novel, but the number it comes up with is within the range of my own best estimate!"  </p>

<h2 id="bio3" class="research"> Quit Smoking And Reclaim Your Life: Risks Of Lung Cancer, Other Diseases Decline Significantly </h2>
<div class="post">
<p> It’s hard to stop smoking. Understanding what immediately happens to your body when you stop smoking, however, will help you kick that habit to the curb for good.</p>

<p>The moment you put down your cigarette, your body is already going through positive changes. Just 20 minutes after you quit, your heart rate will return to normal. After two hours, both your heart rate and blood pressure levels will return to normal — and this is when the nicotine begins to fade out of your system.</p>

<p>Your withdrawal symptoms typically begin between two and 12 hours after your last cigarette, and this is, admittedly, the hard part. Nicotine withdrawal will usually reach its peak about three days after you quit, meaning you’ll experience headaches or nausea, as well as crabbiness. However, at this point the carbon monoxide levels in your blood will have dropped back to normal.</p>

<p>After that, if you can defeat the cravings, you have only good things to look forward to: one to nine weeks after quitting, your coughs, shortness of breath, or burning lungs during physical activity will begin to decrease. Years later, your risk of heart disease as well as your risk of various cancers (including lung cancer) will be half that of a smoker’s risk.</p>

<p>Fifteen years after stopping your smokes, your risk of heart disease is equivalent to that of non-smokers. And if you stop smoking before the age of 30, you’re very likely to live the life of someone who has never smoked before — unless you’ve smoked extensively and done irreparable damage to your lungs that can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
      <p> Putting down the cigarette affects each of your individual body parts, too.</p>

      <p> <strong> Your Brain </strong> </p> 
Cigarettes release “feel-good” chemicals in your brain, having an effect on you that is similar to addictive drugs like heroin. The increased release of these opioids is what makes it so difficult to quit. “It appears that smokers have an altered opioid flow all the time, when compared with non-smokers, and that smoking a cigarette further alters that flow by 20 to 30 percent in regions of the brain important to emotions and craving,” David J. Scott, an author of the study examining smoking’s effect on the brain, said in a news release. Removing nicotine from the bloodflow — which typically occurs several days after you stop smoking — will ultimately alter the opioid flow in your brain, and gradually your brain’s chemicals will return to normal. Once you get past the hurdle of initial cravings and withdrawal, your brain won’t be reliant on those chemicals to feel good.<p>

  <p> <strong>Your Lungs</strong> </p> 
<p>Lungs have this amazing tendency to regenerate rather quickly. Right after you quit, your airways begin to see a decrease in inflammation, and the cilia — little hair-like things that line them — begin to work again after a smoke-induced paralysis. Cilia, which act as the lungs’ cleaning system, begin repairing themselves just days after you stop smoking and can return to their normal function in a few months’ time.</p>

<p>“Paradoxically, people find that they cough a little more right after they stop smoking, but that’s natural,” Laura Blue wrote in Time magazine. “That’s the lungs cleaning themselves out.”</p>

<p> <strong>Your Heart</strong> </p>
<p>Quitting smoking is a more effective way to lower your risk for heart disease than common medications like aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the NIH. The moment you quit smoking, your heart and blood vessels begin to improve, lowering your chance for heart attacks.</p>

<p> <strong>Your Teeth</strong> </p>
<p>Nicotine stains your teeth, so when you stop smoking, you have a chance to improve their whiteness and strength. Your bad breath, stinking of smoke, will also repair itself into something a bit more neutral. Because tar coating your teeth creates a “film” of sorts, bacteria are more likely to settle there and cause tooth decay. Once you stop smoking, you may need to go through an oral hygiene routine to begin scraping away some of the tar on your teeth. Brush and floss twice a day, and drink plenty of water.</p>

<p> <strong>Your Skin</strong> </p>
<p>“Your skin reflects your lifestyle and what you eat and drink,” Dr. Andrew Carmichael told Net Doctor. Indeed, smoking has an effect on your skin — increasing your risk for eczema, and speeding up the aging process. The harmful toxins that enter your body through cigarettes include carbon monoxide, tar, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, mercury, lead, and cadmium — and these all restrict blood flow to the skin and even break down elasticity structures in the skin, like collagen and elastin. This is how smokers’ skin wrinkles so easily.</p>

<p>Though some of the skin damage is permanent, stopping smoking will immediately improve the blood flow and hydration to your skin, making it more full and youthful looking. Drinking plenty of water after smoking cessation will help to get your skin back on track. The processes that lead to extra wrinkles will slow down or stop once the toxins are out of your body. Likewise, if you have bags under your eyes from lack of sleep, removing the smoke from your routine could improve your sleep cycles, according to a Johns Hopkins study.</p>

      <p>So don’t give up just yet. You have better looks and fuller health to look forward to.</p>

<h2 id="tec1" class="research"> AdviceIQ: 12 ways to thwart ID theft </h2> 

<div class="post">
<p> More than 16.6 million people fell victim to identity theft in 2012 and lost a total of $24.7 billion, the Bureau of Justice Statistics says. If you don't want to be one of them, prevention is simpler – and cheaper – than is a cure.<p>

<p>Here are a dozen ways to help do that.The financial consequences of identity theft can be severe. A fraudulent loan in your name, for example, damages your finances, reputation and credit history. Most people don't realize they are a victim until issues show up on their credit report when they buy a house or a car, jeopardizing their ability to make such purchases. Resolving the damage can take a lot of time and money.<p>

<p>Some tips to help you prevent becoming a victim of identity theft: <p>
 <p>   1. Review your credit report regularly to catch any suspicious activity. Check the credit reports of your children. Kids are victims of identity theft, as well.

<p> 2. Use unique passwords for online accounts and banking. Set different passwords for different sites instead of using the same one everywhere. Many password managers exist to securely store your passwords. Enable dual-factor authentication wherever possible. Let's say you are setting security questions, such as "Where did you meet your spouse?" Don't choose things that people can find out through social media or Google.

<p>3. Review your health insurance and medical claims record to ensure that no one else uses your insurance card.</p>

<p>4. Leave your Social Security card, birth certificate and passport at home. Don't carry all your credit cards or any blank checks.</p>

<p>5. Check credit card statements carefully to make sure you know all the purchases.</p>

<p>6. Be careful when you get calls or emails asking for personal information.</p>

<p>7. Beware of mail theft. Choose paperless statements sent directly to your email or smartphone. When you order new checks, do not request them to be delivered in the mail. Go get them from the branch office. This prevents someone from intercepting your mail, and using your checks.<p>

<p>8. Shred all paper documents that contain private information.<p>

<p>9. Protect your personal computer with a strong and updated firewall, an anti-virus program and an anti-spyware program. When you throw away your computer or cell phone, make sure to delete all your personal information by restoring it to factory settings.<p>

<p>10. Be careful when you shop online. Don't store your credit card number on a particular retailer's site. If the website is hacked, your information will be at risk. Keep a separate credit card and email account designated for online purchases. It's easier to track.</p>

<p>11. When you are at the ATM, make sure no one is behind you to see your password. To be safe, cover the account balance information plus the keypad.</p>

<p>12. Educate your teenagers on how to protect themselves from identity theft. In particular, remind them to not to over-share addresses or phone numbers on social media.</p>

        <h2 id="tec2" class="research"> Sophia </h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines.  Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.</p>

<p>Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.</p>

<p>Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.</p>

<p>Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.</p>

<h2 id="tec3" class="research"> Artificial intelligence experts sign open letter to protect mankind from machines </h2>
<div class="post">
<p>We're decades away from being able to develop a sociopathic supercomputer that could enslave mankind, but artificial intelligence experts are already working to stave off the worst when -- not if -- machines become smarter than people. </p>

<p>AI experts around the globe are signing an open letter issued Sunday by the Future of Life Institute that pledges to safely and carefully coordinate progress in the field to ensure it does not grow beyond humanity's control. Signees include co-founders of Deep Mind, the British AI company purchased by Google in January 2014; MIT professors; and experts at some of technology's biggest corporations, including IBM's Watson supercomputer team and Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>"The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence....We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do," the letter said in part. A research document attached to the open letter outlines potential pitfalls and recommends guidelines for continued AI development.</p>

<p>The letter comes after experts have issued warnings about the dangers of super-intelligent machines. Ethicists, for example, worry how a self-driving car might weigh the lives of cyclists versus passengers as it swerves to avoid a collision. Two years ago, a United Nations representative called for a moratorium on the testing, production and use of so-called autonomous weapons that can select targets and begin attacks without human intervention.</p>

<p>Famed physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk have also voiced their concerns about allowing artificial intelligence to run amok. "One can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand," Hawking said in an article he co-wrote in May for The Independent. "Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all."</p>

<p>Musk in August tweeted "we need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes."</p>

<p>"I'm increasingly inclined to think there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish," he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in October.</p>
<p>The Future of Life Institute is a volunteer-only research organization whose primary goal is mitigating the potential risks of human-level manmade intelligence that could subsequently advance exponentially. It was founded by scores of mathematicians and computer science experts around the world, chiefly Jaan Tallinn, a co-founder of Skype, and MIT professor Max Tegmark.</p>

<p>The long-term plan is to stop treating fictional dystopias as pure fantasy and to begin readily addressing the possibility that intelligence greater than our own could one day begin acting against its programming.</p>

<h2 id="phi1" class="research"> 11 Common Traits Of Highly Intelligent People</h2>
<div class="post">
<p> Over on Quora, more than 100 people have answered the question "What are the common traits of highly intelligent people?" </p>

<p>Some users claim to know from personal experience (so humble); others are just taking an educated guess.</p>

<p>As it turns out, many users gave answers that researchers would agree with.</p>

<p>We pulled eleven of the most intriguing Quora responses and explained the science behind them. Here's what we learned.</p>

<p><strong>1. They're highly adaptable </strong></p>

<p>Several Quora users noted that intelligent people are flexible and able to thrive in different settings. As Donna F Hammett writes, intelligent people adapt by "showing what can be done regardless of the complications or restrictions placed upon them."</p>

<p>Recent psychological research supports this idea. Intelligence depends on being able to change your own behaviors in order to cope more effectively with your environment, or make changes to the environment you're in.</p>

<p><strong>2. They understand how much they don't know</strong></p>

<p>The smartest folks are able to admit when they aren't familiar with a particular concept. As Jim Winer writes, intelligent people "are not afraid to say: 'I don't know.' If they don't know it, they can learn it."</p>

<p>Winer's observation is backed up by a classic study by Justin Kruger and David Dunning, which found that the less intelligent you are, the more you overestimate your cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>In one experiment, for example, students who'd scored in the lowest quartile on a test adapted from the LSAT overestimated the number of questions they'd gotten right by nearly 50%. Meanwhile, those who'd scored in the top quartile slightly underestimated how many questions they'd gotten right.</p>

<p><strong>3. They have insatiable curiosity</strong></p>

<p>Albert Einstein reportedly said, "I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious."</p>

<p>Or, as Keyzurbur Alas puts it, "intelligent people let themselves become fascinated by things others take for granted."</p>

<p>Research published in 2016 suggests that there's a link between childhood intelligence and openness to experience — which encompasses intellectual curiosity — in adulthood.</p>

<p>Scientists followed thousands of people born in the UK for 50 years and learned that 11-year-olds who'd scored higher on an IQ test turned out to be more open to experience at 50.</p>
<p><strong>4. They're open-minded</strong></p>

<p>Smart people don't close themselves off to new ideas or opportunities. Hammett writesthat intelligent people are "willing to accept and consider other views with value and broad-mindedness," and that they are "open to alternative solutions."</p>

<p>Psychologists say that open-minded people — those who seek out alternate viewpoints and weigh the evidence fairly — tend to score higher on the SAT and on intelligence tests.</p>

<p>At the same time, smart people are careful about which ideas and perspectives they adopt.</p>

<p>"An intelligent mind has a strong aversion to accepting things on face value and therefore withholds belief until presented with ample evidence," says Alas.</p>

<p><strong>5. They like their own company</strong></p>

<p>Dipankar Trehan points out that highly intelligent people tend to be "very individualistic."</p>

<p>Interestingly, recent research suggests that smarter people tend to derive less satisfaction than most people do from socializing with friends.</p>

<p><strong>6. They have high self-control</strong></p>

<p>Zoher Ali writes that smart people are able to overcome impulsiveness by "planning, clarifying goals, exploring alternative strategies and considering consequences before [they] begin."</p>

<p>Scientists have found a link between self-control and intelligence. In one 2009 study, participants had to choose between two financial rewards: a smaller payout immediately or a larger payout at a later date.</p>

<p>Results showed that participants who chose the larger payout at a later date — i.e., those who had more self-control — generally scored higher on intelligence tests.</p>

<p>The researchers behind that study say that one area of the brain — the anterior prefrontal cortex — might play a role in helping people solve tough problems and demonstrate self-control while working toward goals.</p>

<p><strong>7. They're really funny</strong></p>

<p> Bihani points out that highly intelligent people tend to have a great sense of humor.</p>

<p>Scientists agree. One study found that people who wrote funnier cartoon captions scored higher on measures of verbal intelligence. Another study found that professional comedians scored higher than average on measures of verbal intelligence.  </p>  
<p><strong>8. They're sensitive to other people's experiences</strong></p>

<p>Smart people can "almost feel what someone is thinking/feeling," says one Quora user.</p>

<p>Some psychologists argue that empathy, being attuned to the needs and feelings of others and acting in a way that is sensitive to those needs, is a core component of emotional intelligence. Emotionally-intelligent individuals are typically very interested in talking to new people and learning more about them.</p>

<p><strong>9. They can connect seemingly unrelated concepts</strong></p>

<p>Several Quora users suggested that smart people are able to see patterns where others can't. That's because they can draw parallels between seemingly disparate ideas.</p>

<p>As April Astoria notes: "You think there's no relation between sashimi and watermelon? You'd be wrong. Both are typically eaten raw and cold."</p>

<p>Interestingly, journalist Charles Duhigg argues that making these kinds of connections is a hallmark of creativity (which, depending on who you ask, can be closely linked to intelligence). Duhigg studied the process through which Disney developed their hit movie "Frozen" and concluded that the movie only seems clever and original because it "takes old ideas and pushes them together in new ways."</p>

<p><strong>10. They procrastinate a lot</strong></p>

<p>Mahesh Garkoti says smart people are likely to procrastinate on quotidian tasks, mainly because they're working on things that are more important.</p>

<p>That's an interesting proposition — but some scientists would say that smart people procrastinate even on work they find meaningful. Wharton psychologist Adam Grant suggests that procrastination is key to innovation, and that Steve Jobs used it strategically.</p>

<p>As Grant told Business Insider's Rachel Gillett, "The time Steve Jobs was putting things off and noodling on possibilities was time well spent in letting more divergent ideas come to the table, as opposed to diving right in with the most conventional, the most obvious, the most familiar."</p>

        <p> <strong>11. They contemplate the big questions</strong></p>

<p>According to Ram Kumar, intelligent individuals "wonder a lot about [the] universe and meaning of life." What's more, Kumar writes, "they always [ask] what's the point of everything?"</p>

<p>That existential confusion may be one reason why smart people are more likely to be anxious. As David Wilson reported in Slate, intelligent people may be better equipped to consider situations from a range of angles, meaning they're always aware of the possibility that things will go awry. Perhaps their anxiety also stems from the fact that they consider a given experience and wonder: Why bother going through it in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="phi2" class="research"> Philosophy of Mental Illness </h2>
    <div class="post">
<p>The Philosophy of Mental Illness is an interdisciplinary field of study that combines views and methods from the philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience, and moral philosophy in order to analyze the nature of mental illness. Philosophers of mental illness are concerned with examining the ontological, epistemological, and normative issues arising from varying conceptions of mental illness.</p>

<p>Central questions within the philosophy of mental illness include: whether the concept of a mental illness can be given a scientifically adequate, value-free, specification; whether mental illnesses should be understood as a form of distinctly mental dysfunction, and whether mental illnesses are best identified as discrete mental entities with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria or as points along a continuum between the normal and the ill. Philosophers critical of the concept of mental illness argue that it is not possible to give a value-neutral specification of mental illnesses. They argue that that our concept of mental illnesses is often used to disguise the ways in which mental illness categories enforce pre-existing norms and power relations. Questions remain about the relationship between the role that values play within the concept of mental illness and how those values relate to concepts of illness more generally. Philosophers who consider themselves a part of the neurodiversity movement claim that our concept of mental illness should be revised to reflect the diverse forms of cognition that humans are capable of without stigmatizing individuals that are statistically non-normal.</p>

<p>There are also epistemological issues concerning the relationship between mental illness and diagnosis. Historically, the central issue centers on how nosologies (or classification-schemas) of mental illness, especially the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM), relate mental dysfunctions with observable symptoms. Mental dysfunction, on the DSM system, is identified via the presence or absence of a set of symptoms from a checklist. Those critical of the use of behavioral symptoms to diagnose mental disorders argue that symptoms are useless without a theoretically adequate conception of what it means for a mental mechanism to function poorly. A minimal constraint on a diagnostic system is that it must be able to distinguish a person with a genuine mental illness from a person suffering from a problem with living. Critics argue that the DSM, as currently constituted, cannot do this.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are a host of questions surrounding the relationship between mental illness and normativity. If mental illness undermines rational agency, then there are questions about the degree to which the mentally ill are capable of autonomous decision-making. This bears on questions regarding the degree of moral and legal responsibility that the mentally ill can be assigned. Further questions about agency arise over bioethical questions about the standing of the demands made on healthcare professionals by the mentally ill. For example, individuals with Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) request that surgeons amputate their healthy limbs in order to restore a balance between their internal self-representation and their external body image. Bioethicists are divided over whether the requests of patients with BIID are genuinely autonomous and deserving of assent.</p>

<h2 id="psy1" class="research"> The Science of Violence</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Violence at political rallies, terrorism, and horrifying workplace shootings bewilder us, but they shouldn’t. Traditional approaches to understanding violence seem played out. What we need is an understanding of violence at the level of brain circuitry. Violence, like all human behavior, is controlled by the brain. From the everyday road rage, to domestic violence, to a suicide bombing, the biology of anger and aggression is the root cause of most violent behavior. </p>


<p>Viewing violence narrowly from the perspective of psychological dysfunction shirks the larger truth that the biological roots of rage exist in all of us. The leading risk of death throughout the prime of life is not disease. It is violence. If you survive into old age you will most likely die from disease, but according to CDC statistics for deaths in the United States for the year 2014, life ends at the hand of another human so frequently, that from early childhood through middle-age, homicide is the third to 5th most common cause of death in all age brackets between 1-44 years. </p>
      
<p>A psychopath or a foreign terrorist is not the likely villain. The data show that the murderer is twice as likely to be your friend or acquaintance as it is to be a stranger. Deadly violence against oneself (suicide) is second only to accidental injury as the most frequent way we die between the ages of 10 and 34. </p>


<p>The most important factor in violence is not pathology, psychology, or politics-- it is biology. Nine out of ten people in prison for violent crime are men. Males die from homicide at three times the rate of women. When the victim is a spouse or intimate partner women are murdered at 3.3 times the rate of men. Males commit suicide at four times the rate of females. Violence and maleness is a biological fact that runs through the vast diversity of cultures and through our ancestral tree to other primates. </p>


<p>We have neural circuits of rage and violence because we need them. As a species we needed deadly violence to obtain food, to protect ourselves, our family, our group, and unfortunately we still need them today. Order in society is maintained through violence, meted out methodically by police and nations according to laws that benefit society at large, but this organized violence is founded on the same neurocircuitry of aggression wired into the human brain of every individual. </p>
<p>We are on the brink of a new understanding of the neuroscience of violence. Like detectives slipping a fiber optic camera under a door, neuroscientists insert a fiber optic microcamera into the brain of an experimental animal and watch the neural circuits of rage respond during violent behavior. Neurons genetically modified to flash bursts of light when they fire reveal where these circuits of rage are in the brain, and neuroscientists can stimulate or squelch the firing of a neuron they target by laser beam. With the flip of a switch neuroscientists can launch an animal into a violent attack or arrest a violent battle underway by activating or quelling the firing of specific neurons in the brain’s rage circuits. Technological advances in monitoring brainwaves and brain imaging are bringing new insight into this same circuitry at work in the human brain. These circuits of aggression are part of the brain’s threat detection mechanism embedded deep in the unconscious region of the brain where sex, thirst, and feeding are also controlled. Struggling to comprehend a suicide bomber’s “thinking” or police searching for “motives” in cases where violence is driven by perceptions of threat, alienation or emotion is a search in vain. Such violence is not driven by reason. It is driven by rage.</p>


<p>Our current perspective views violence as pathology and seeks to find common elements that unite all violent behavior. “The different forms of violence—child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, elder abuse and suicidal behavior—are interconnected and often share the same root causes,” the CDC concludes in its strategic vision statement. But lumping together all forms of violence in an attempt to find a common denominator has created the incomprehensible muddle we find ourselves in today, as we struggle to comprehend a school shooting, or worshipers slaughtered inside a church by racial hatred. The sickening violence of Sandy Hook, which was the product of a broken mind, cannot be lumped together with the violence of the terrorists in San Bernardino, or violence committed in a robbery, or the everyday violence of barroom brawls, domestic violence, or deadly road rage. Each of these violent acts can be understood as specific behaviors that are controlled, as are all behaviors, by specific circuits in the brain activated by specific triggers.</p>


<p>Most of the time the neural circuits of aggression are life-saving, as when a mother instantly reacts aggressively to protect her child in danger, but sometimes they misfire and violence explodes inappropriately, as in a road rage shooting. The pressures of modern life constantly press on these triggers of rage. International communication and high-speed transportation increase opportunities for conflict between different groups of people. Weapons of violence amplify the lethal effects of one enraged mind well beyond the power of any individual to combat with bare hands. Add to this the toxic effects of psychoactive drugs for treating mental illnesses and drugs of abuse, compounded by the increasing stress, crowding, and sensory bombardment of the modern world, and we see the human brain struggling to cope with an environment it was never designed to confront. </p>


<p>We cannot hope to control violence if we are bewildered by it. The CDC statistics strongly suggest that in addition to understanding the biological basis of disease, there is a much greater unmet need for neuroscience research to understand the biological underpinnings of violent behavior. We cannot change the biology of our brain, but if we choose to, we can comprehend it at the same level of detail that we comprehend the biology of a human heartbeat. </p>

<h2 id="psy2" class="research"> Sleep Walking: Facts, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment</h2>
<div class="post"><p>Imagine waking up somewhere other than where you fell asleep and not remembering how you got there. That’s what may happen to people who sleepwalk. Sleepwalking involves performing a complex action, such as walking, while still asleep. Additional activities may also be performed during a sleepwalking episode. For example, some people who sleepwalk may go to the kitchen and eat or unlock a door and walk outside. Although uncommon, there have been incidences of sleepwalkers getting in their car and driving without waking up.</p>

<p>People who sleepwalk often remain in a deep state of sleep throughout their episode. Although it varies, sleepwalkers may not remember their sleepwalking episodes.</p>

<p> <strong> Sleepwalking Facts</strong></p>
<p>Sleepwalking is a parasomnia, which is a type of sleep disorder that involves abnormal behaviors or movements during sleep. Sleepwalking is not as rare a disorder as once thought. According to a study conducted by Stanford University School of Medicine, about 8.4 million people or about 3.6 percent of the population are prone to sleepwalking. Episodes of sleepwalking are most likely to occur a few hours after falling asleep. Sleepwalking episodes are typically brief only lasting a few minutes.</p>

<p>Although sleepwalking occurs in adults, it is more common in kids. Sleepwalking in children is usually not an indication of emotional problems. According to the Cleveland Clinic, most children who sleepwalk outgrow the behavior by their teen years.</p>

<p><strong>What Causes Sleepwalking?</strong></p>
<p>Sleepwalkers appear to be in an unusual state between wakefulness and sleep. But the person who is sleepwalking is truly asleep. As you sleep, you go through different stages including cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. As you enter the beginning of deep sleep, your brain produces slow delta waves, but you have not yet entered REM sleep. Sleepwalking is most likely to occur during this stage of non-REM, slow-wave sleep when it’s a little harder for you to be awakened.</p>

<p>Why some people sleepwalk is not fully understood, but researchers have discovered a few risk factors. For example, sleepwalking tends to run in families, which indicates a genetic link.</p>

<p>According to researchers at Stanford, people with certain psychiatric issues, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, have an increased risk of sleepwalking. Also, people who are prone to the disorder may be more likely to sleepwalk when they are sleep deprived, anxious or have an illness.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms of Sleepwalking</strong></p>
<p>The signs of sleepwalking may be obvious. The most common sign is getting up from bed while still asleep and walking around. Additional symptoms of sleepwalking may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking during sleep</li>

<li>Acting confused after being awakened</li>
<li>Not communicating with others when spoken to</li>
<li>A glossy-eyed expression</li>
  <li>Clumsiness</li> </ul>
<p>A diagnosis of sleepwalking is usually made by a family member, roommate or partner’s account of the sleepwalker’s behavior. In some cases, a physician may want to rule out psychological issues that may be associated with an increased risk of sleepwalking. Also, if a sleep disorder is suspected, a sleep study may be recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of Sleepwalking </strong> </p>
<p>In many cases, no specific treatment is required for sleepwalking, especially for children. Most doctors recommend parents create a safe environment, so kids don’t get hurt rather than treating sleepwalking itself.</p>

<p>If children do not outgrow sleepwalking by their teen years or they are at risk of injury during episodes, it’s best to talk to your child’s doctor. Although medication is not usually recommended for children who sleepwalk, improved sleep habits or scheduled awakenings may be options.</p>

<p>Treatment for adults who sleepwalk may also not be needed. But if sleepwalking is leading to unusual or negative behavior during sleep, such as leaving the house or driving, treatment be advised. Medication is sometimes used to decrease episodes of sleepwalking. For instance, antidepressants or medication to treat anxiety may be prescribed for sleepwalking that’s a problem.</p>

<p>If an additional underlying sleep disorder is present, it could be contributing to fatigue and sleepwalking. Treating the disorder may reduce sleepwalking and improve overall sleep and wellbeing.</p>

<p>People who sleepwalk can also take certain measures to improve their sleep quality and prevent sleep deprivation. For example, doing relaxation exercises before bed to reduce stress and limiting alcohol may minimize sleepwalking episodes.</p>

<p>One important factor is to make sure the environment is safe for sleepwalkers, so they don’t injure themselves during a sleepwalking incident. For instance, minimize the risk of tripping and falling by moving obstacles and clutter.</p>

<p>The good news is for most people sleepwalking is not an indication of a serious disorder. Sleepwalking often goes away on its own or with improved sleep habits.</p>

<p><strong>Sleepwalking FAQ’s</strong></p>
<p>Is it OK to wake someone who is sleepwalking? It is a myth that you should not wake someone who is sleepwalking because it will cause a serious problem, such as a heart attack. Gently guiding a sleepwalker back to bed is fine. Keep in mind; someone is awoken during sleepwalking may be startled and appear disoriented for a moment.</p>

<p>Can I prevent sleepwalking? Sleepwalking may not always be preventable. But people are more likely to sleepwalk if they are overly tired. Sleepwalking may decrease if you get enough rest. Developing good habits can improve the quality of your sleep. For example, limit naps to 30 minutes, get enough sunlight during the day and avoid stimulants, such as caffeine several hours before bed. If possible, try to go to sleep and wake up around the same time each day to get into a natural sleep rhythm.</p>

<p>Is sleepwalking dangerous? Sleepwalking itself is not necessarily dangerous. But in some cases, sleepwalkers can injure themselves during an episode. If sleepwalking leads to prolonged disruption of sleep, it can also lead to fatigue and daytime sleepiness.</p>

<p>How can I keep my child safe if they sleepwalk? If your child sleepwalks, creating a safe environment is the most important factor. To keep your child out of harm’s way consider removing clutter in their path, installing gates on stairways and make sure windows and doors are locked. Also, don’t let your child sleep on the top bunk of bunk beds if he is a sleepwalker.</p>
