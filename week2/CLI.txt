1. Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.

$ touch Aya.txt
$ attrib +s +h Aya.txt


2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

$ mkdir -p A/y/a/A/l/h/a/m/w/i/
$ mkdir -p /c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun
or 
$ cd unmesh 
mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun


3. Execute following commands terminal:
echo "test" > fun : This will create a file that contains the word text
echo "another test" >> fun : This will paste the other text into the same file
wc -c fun : this will print the byte counts

Verify number of characters in the file. :  $ wc fun
or $ wc -m fun

4. Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test

$ echo "test" > fun

$ echo -n "testanother" > fun

$ cat fun
testtestanother

How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test

$ echo "testanother test" > fun
